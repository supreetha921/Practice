        dataService.getFoodItems(response => {
            $scope.foodItems = response.data;
        });

        //if the url is equal to the edit/recipeID then get that recipe
        if($location.url() === '/edit/' + $routeParams.id){
            dataService.getRecipesByID($routeParams.id, response => {
                $scope.recipe = response.data;
            });
        }
        //push to array when add ingredient
        $scope.addIngredient = recipe => {
            recipe.ingredients.push({
                "foodItem": "",
                "condition": "",
                "amount": ""
            })

        //delete ingredient with splice
        $scope.deleteIngredient = ($index) => {
            $scope.recipe.ingredients.splice($index, 1)
        };
